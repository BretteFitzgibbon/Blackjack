Let's Play BlackJack!
How to Play BlackJack

The object of the game is to have a hand of cards whose values add up to 21. Each card has a value matching its number, except for Ace(1) and Jack, Queen, and King (10). A player competes with a dealer. At each turn, the player and dealer can choose to receive another card (hit) or to stop collecting cards (stand). If the player or dealer's total exceeds 21, the game ends and that person loses. If the player has a total of 21, and then the dealer takes a turn and obtains a total of 21, the dealer wins. Otherwise, the player wins. If both the player and the dealer stand, then the person whose total is closest to 21 wins. If the player's and dealer's scores are equal, then the dealer wins.
